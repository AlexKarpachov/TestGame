# Tower Defense Prototype (MVP)

## Description
This is a prototype (Minimum Viable Product) created in **1 day** as part of a test assignment. The objective of the task was to build a game where the player defends a location from enemies approaching along a fixed path. The player must place obstacles or weapons on the path to stop the enemies from reaching the target.

## Concept
After reviewing the assignment, I decided to base the game mechanics on the **Tower Defense** genre, where similar logic is used. The core gameplay involves strategic placement of defense mechanisms to counter waves of enemies.

## Development Process
- The prototype was built within 1 day, focusing on the core mechanics: enemy movement along a defined route and player interaction to place defenses.
- The player can select and place obstacles or weapons along the path, which will automatically attack or block the enemies.
- Enemies follow a pre-set path and are stopped by defenses if they are placed strategically.

## Features
- **Basic enemy pathfinding**: Enemies follow a fixed route toward the player's base.
- **Defense placement**: The player can place obstacles or towers along the path to slow down or eliminate enemies.
- **Simple game mechanics**: This prototype demonstrates the core Tower Defense mechanics, suitable for further development.

## Next Steps
- Expanding the variety of towers and enemy types.
- Adding levels with different paths and increasing difficulty.
- Implementing additional gameplay elements such as upgrading towers and special abilities.

This MVP serves as a foundation for future development and is a functional demonstration of the requested game concept.
